The program secures the user's personal identifiers with GPT by encrypting the data before it is stored. The encryption key is stored in a secure location, and only the program has access to the key. This ensures that the data cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

In addition, the program only stores the minimum amount of data necessary to generate a health score for the food item. This reduces the risk of the data being compromised.
